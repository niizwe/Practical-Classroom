   <b> The battle of Kalinge transformed Ashoka, the Great
(268-223 BC) from a ruthless cruel leader to a kind,
gentle person. He was sincerely grieved to witness
first-hand, the huge number of casualties caused by
his military campaigns. He brought about a number
of changes and established the first known animal
rights laws. In his edicts, King Ashoka expresses his
concern about the number of animals killed and
made his intentions very clear to end such killings. </b>
<br>
</br>
<strong>He therefore, stopped royal hunting parties and
also ended the killing of animals for the royal kitchen. He outlawed the sacrifice of animals and
made it illegal to kill many species such as parrots, ducks, geese, turtles, monkeys and rhinos</strong>

<u>So many times we come across wounded and sick birds, but
ignore them because we do not have the knowledge of
where to take them for proper treatment an d cure. We see
birds electrocuted in electric wires, dehydrated during
summers, wounded during storms, tree felling, aircraft
collisions, etc.</u>

  Transported in bags or clasped between hands, 30-40
birds arrive in a day. In summers, they are often
dehydrated or injured by moving fans and in winter
they suffer from pneumonia.The winged patients can seek a remedy for everything from pigeon
pox to the common cold. The birds are first kept held in the intensive care unit and are then
transferred to the general wards, where they regain their wings and eventually fly off.</FONT>

From time immemorial, elephants have been an integral part of
history, tradition, myths and culture of India and Kerala in
particular. One cannot lorem <br> imagine a festival in ‘God’s Own Country’
without the presence of an elephant. Just like dogs or cats, these big
mammals are also considered pets.
